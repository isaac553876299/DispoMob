DESIGN

App to provide a tool to easily administrate a tasks calendar.

The idea is to keep track (as user-friendly and efficiently as possible) of a list of tasks ordered in time.
It allows the creation of a work group for any single task.
Its creator becomes the administrator and has power to delete it, as well as managing its attached users.
Although, editing the task contents is public by default.

Screens & Format:
    calendar -> grid of the days, small icons with an specific color to know the work for each day.
        :: grid(days) + button(month).

    day -> list of its tasks
        :: list(tasks widgets) + buttons(add/delete(hold)/edit).

    task -> *see description
        :: column(*properties) + buttons(delete/edit).

    chat -> complete history of messages
        :: list(messages) + text field(input) + button(send).

Structure of the database:
    tasks -> list of currently existing tasks (not deleted).
        task -> *see description.
            chat -> list of messages (sender?).
    users -> list of accounts registered (password?).
        tasks -> list of attached tasks(id).

Description of a task:
    administrator/creator user id
    list of attached users id
    deadline/time
    description text
    level of importance/priority
    todos list
    chat (polls?)

*Idea subject to changes during the holidays.
